brief: Experimenting with a custom Bezier curve implementation, with a variable amount of control points.
---

## Instructions

-   Click/tap somewhere on the canvas to place a point.
-   Press Space to reset all of the points.

## About

Bezier curve implementation that is currently unused within any projects.

I like using this as a first sketch when re-writing my portfolio. It's relatively easy to implement, so it's good for testing.

The [Wikipedia page for Bezier Curves][0] describes the algorithm for calculating a curve.
