## Preface
This is my first blog post, and I wanted to share the story of my most recent passion project, my keyboard.

I'm not sure what I wanted the outcome of this to be. I hope you find my directionless rambling somewhat entertaining.

## An Idea Forms
About a year ago, I noticed that my coworker, Lachlan, had a split keyboard. At the time I didn't know them very well,
but I still initiated a conversation, interested in the rationale.

Lachlan's rationale happened to strike a cord with me, as he originally got the keyboard to prevent wrist pain.
Although I did not know Lachlan very well, I definitely understood his pain, experiencing symptoms of carpal tunnel at the young age of 20.

I learnt of a subreddit, through Lachlan, called [r/ErgoMechKeyboards].

From that subreddit, I discovered that mine and Lachlan's experience of wrist pain was not an isolated case.
I also heard anecdotes that the discomfort I had come to dread could be mitigated.

I decided that I would take the plunge.

## Research, Research
Although I had decided to take the plunge, such a dramatic dive couldn't be done without some research.

Firstly, I wanted to know how they worked. I knew the basics of a keyboard, translating some key press into some key code for the OS to decipher.
How did a keyboard know which key was pressed though?

From that train of thought, I learnt about matrix keyboards, and these things called "diodes". I also discovered that diodes were tiny, and that you needed a lot of them.

This news was a bit daunting for me, as I had no prior experience soldering. What I also discovered, thought, was that if you have a small enough keyboard, with a low enough key count, you didn't need those pesky diodes.

With the DIY standard micro-controller, a Pro-Micro, you could theoretically support 17 keys per side of the keyboard, without the need for diodes at all.

I had decided that small form factor was the way to go.

## ... Procrastinate, Procrastinate
You might be saying, "Wait what do you mean 'Procrastinate, Procrastinate'? You finally decided what you were going to do!".

Well I wish I had that voice in my ear 7 months ago, because you're right. I didn't mention it yet, but I even devised a custom key-map that I was going to use.

I'm not totally sure what it was, maybe the fact that I was also learning [NeoVim] again, or had just moved to a new role at work... Whatever it was, I was stumped.

Cue 7 months of fantasising what it would be like to work without hand or wrist pain.

## Along Comes a Saviour
After months, one of my coworkers got a position in the team that I was already working in. We were already acquainted, but I got to know him better, and eventually got to rambling.

The rambling started off as the usual, but at some point, I started talking to him about my desire to have my own split keyboard.

This coworker, Campbell, ordered all of the parts the next night. Two weeks later, the parts arrived. On the weekend, Lachlan (who I had become good friends with at this point), Campbell and I, are sitting on Campbell's porch, trying our best not to huff too much lead from soldering.

An hour or two later and it was finished. We loaded it up with some default firmware, and... it was okay.

## Disappointment, or Opportunity?
Well that all felt so fast paced, and very anti-climactic. Where to go now?

I already knew that I wasn't going to be satisfied with some default firmware from the beginning, and I thought ahead. All I had to do now was program the firmware that I had already devised.

That was the problem though. The standard framework to write programmable keyboard firmware with, is [QMK].

[QMK] is a project that aims to provide "a completely customizable, powerful, and enjoyable firmware experience". Unfortunately, and fortunately, that meant that I was going to have to learn how to utilise a C firmware that has been in active development for nearly a decade now.

I'm sure to long-time C developers, those sound like rookie numbers. For me though, that was daunting. The last time I had programmed in C was nearly 6 years ago at this point.

## Time To Walk The Walk
Before Campbell and I had built our keyboards, I had made a promise that I would be able to write whatever firmware features he needed. Basically, I had "talked the talk".

Now it was time to walk the walk.

I followed [QMK]'s newb's tutorial to [Build QMK with GitHub Userspace](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_building_firmware_workflow?id=building-qmk-with-github-userspace), and started tinkering.

The issue though, was that Campbell and I wanted to make heavy use of the [Combos Feature](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_combo?id=combos), which required a working C source for the key-map.
This would not be an issue if I would just be content with the defaults, but I could not stand having my key codes defined in a JSON file, with the logic in C.

I wanted to find a clean way to implement both the keyboard layout, as well as the logic, all in the C source.

In retrospect, this is quite easy to achieve. At the time, though? I'll let this screenshot of my GitHub actions speak for itself.

## Okay But What About Actually Using It?
Alright, I suppose I've been rambling about the journey, now let's talk about the destination. 

I wrote about the anecdotes of the users from [r/ErgoMechKeyboards], and how they inspired me to start this process. Luckily for me, I am able to say that I experienced the same as them.

I forgot to mention it, but from the start of typing with this new keyboard, I also decided to learn a new key layout: [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/).

Before everything, I was typing at a clean average of 110 words per minute (WPM) on a standard US QWERTY keyboard. I knew that my typing speed would go down before going into this.

The first month of typing, I was sitting at an average of 30 WPM. It was unbearable, I constantly had the urge to use my laptop keyboard, but I struggled through, and have now reached an average of 80 WPM again.

That number is still lower, and at times, it's still frustrating not being able to speed type a feature into existence. That frustration comes with a major bliss balancing it out.

The major bliss? I feel comfortable typing now.

## Conclusion
I can type comfortably, and feel that my development speed is just as quick as before. Most people don't think faster than 80 WPM anyways.

Having to use somebody else's keyboard makes my hands instantly start hurting again. I'd say that's a success.

Would I recommend anybody else follow the same path as me? Yes. I've already been attempting to indoctrinate my peers into joining me.

I can also now switch between QWERTY and Colemak-DH with little to no transition time.
