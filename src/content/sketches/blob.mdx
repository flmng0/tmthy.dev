## Instructions

Move your mouse cursor over, or tap somewhere on, the outline of the circle above.


## Explanation

Under the hood, the circle is actually a large number of "particles" that are all individually simulated.

For each particle, apply the following forces:

- A repelling force away from the mouse cursor / most recent tap.
- An attractive force, back to where the particle spawned.
- An attractive force, which attracts a particle towards its 2 nearest neighbours.
- A friction force which, in this case, is a force in the opposite direction of the current movement.

The repelling force gets weaker the further away the particle gets from the repeller.

Both of the attractive forces have the opposite; they are stronger the further the particle is from its attractor.

A naive implementation of verlet integration is used to actually simulate the particles.
