            <h1>Hello! I'm Timothy Davis</h1>
            <p>
                This website is under active development, I only started (re)developing it on the
                7th of March 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
                I created this website as a place to store all of my little projects, and to
                distract myself from work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually this will be a fully fledged portfolio. As you could probably tell, that
                is not the case yet.
            </p>

                I would recommend the <a href="/sketches">sketches</a> page to see some toy projects.
