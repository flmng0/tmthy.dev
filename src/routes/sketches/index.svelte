<!-- Load a list of sketches into a CardList,
    where each sketch is a DisplayCard.

    Also, make sure to put some description text
    at the top of the page, to explain what a
    "sketch" represents, especially versus a project.

    The above paragraph also makes me consider putting
    sketches and projects onto the same page.
