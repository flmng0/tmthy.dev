			years old, and have been developing since I was 9. I graduated high-school in 2020 as the
			DUX of my grade, with an ATAR of 86.55. I achieved STEM Student of the Year for the Northern
			Territory in the same year.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the past 10 years, I've been making projects to improve my skills. As every
			developer I know, I started off making games. I then moved on to game engines, and then
			automation and reporting.
		</p>

		<p>
			After all this time, making games is still my favourite passtime. I would happily show
			them to you... but my bad habit is not finishing projects. For instance, the website
			you're looking at right now went un-touched for a good month or two.
		</p>

		<p>
			For a portfolio, that last paragraph doesn't make me sound good, so let me just give you
			the "specs" instead.
